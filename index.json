It is equipped with an onboard Pan-360 vision system that provides visual feedback which is then transmitted to the operator thereby enabling better control of the robot‚Äôs movement. A manually operated spherical robot has been designed that provides visual feedback for reconnaissance and search. The design of the robot can be easily modified to add sensors for collecting application-specific information to the operator.

Gazebo, RViz Troubleshooting real robot hardware  SPHERICAL ROBOT Spherical robots are non-holonomic rolling robots that have advantages compared to 4WD robots to manevoure in cluttered indoor environment. The spherical robot has yoke having actuator that drives the robot ahead with pendulums to steer with shift of CoM.   DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT My research involved developing a novel palm-sized robot that has ergonomic design. Focused in developing compact spherical robot that can be easily deployed. I contributed in rapid prototyping of the robot. Spherical robot has symmetric body and CoM plays a crucial role. Designing a robot considering its CoM to lie on a calculated co-ordinate involved in numerous iterations and prototyping. Design was developed in SOLIDWORKS and to understand its motion it was simulated in MATLAB Multibody Simulation (Simmechanics).     CONTROL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT Developing software to integrate all elements. Along with sensor interfacing such as IMU and encoders. Worked on embedded control algorithms to reduce wobble of spherical robot and for position and velocity control of actuators. Contributed to a ROS package for spherical bots. Validated feedback control algorithms with ground truth from VICON Motion capture systems.  REAL ROBOT HARDWARE Spherical robot investigations included great extent of experimentation, testing \u0026 on field deployments. Worked on deployments with real robot hardware and its troubleshooting. Furthermore investigated in fabrication of polycarbonate Hull (outer shell) and its design analysis.

The damage caused by earthquakes is massive which leads to destruction of buildings, roads, bridges etc. The victims are often trapped under such damaged structures, whose structural integrity is uncertain, thus acting as a barrier to the rescue operations. The primary idea behind developing Earthquake Rescue and Relief Operations Robot (ERROR bot) is to remove that barrier by deploying it in those regions and carrying out relief operations. Rescue bots must be rugged, robust and be able to move around in a multitude of terrains. This is particularly required because a region hit by an earthquake will have debris everywhere making the terrain highly irregular and non-uniform, and thus would be impossible to cover by traditional bots equipped with wheels. The ERROR bot overcomes this kind of limitation because it was designed with all-terrain motion in mind. The unique Tensegrity structures which constitute the entire body of the ERROR bot allow for robustness, ruggedness, and all-terrain motion. The other and the most important reason for opting such an unusual shape is that Tensegrity structures have this unique property of sustaining impacts by absorbing shocks, which makes it ideal to be used in relief operations. The flexible structure of the bot makes use of a to-and-fro motion much like that of an amoeba. ERROR bot is controlled by a user situated in a remote place using a Graphical User Interface that provides both the controls as well as a visual feedback or the first person view(FPV) of the bot using a camera placed in the structure. User monitors the FPV of the bot and searches for a possible survivor and when it finds one it delivers the relief gear to that survivor, that can be anything from vaccines, first-aid, knife etc. ","date":1520380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520380800,"objectID":"1de7433b875e92beb90243e6a8351bf1","permalink":"https://vaibhav02kadam.github.io/patent/tensegrity_patent/","publishdate":"2018-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/patent/tensegrity_patent/","section":"patent","summary":"ERROR (Earthquake Rescue and Relief Operations Robot) is **Tensegrity** based robot that can maneuver over uneven surface by linear motion of its 6 struts.
