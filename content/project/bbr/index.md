### ABOUT THE PROJECT

  - Generally differential drive **mobile robots** are *non holonomic*. The motion constraints pose hinderance in manuevering in indoor cluttered environments.
  -  The work focuses on *holonomic* **Ball-Balancing Robot (BBR)**. 
  - BBR system is inherently unstable, and can be dynamically stable. BBR does not have any constraint and need to turn in cluttered places. 
  - It is equipped with a kinect sensor for providing vision capabilities using which it could simultaneously localize itself and map its surroundings (SLAM) that would result in a seamless motion. 
  - The investigations focused on control of BBR system by linearizing its complex non-linear model and use LQR and PID controllers to achieve stability.

### SKILLS INVOLVED
  - Dynamics and Kinematics modelling
  - Design development
  - DC motor control
  - Jetson TK1
  - ROS C++
  - Control Algorithm development
