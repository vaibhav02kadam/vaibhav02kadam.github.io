abstract: Mobile base with omnidirectional wheels have the advantage of unrestricted maneuverability. We investigate the use of spherical robots as omnidirectional wheels. A three link assembly with snap joint for each robot is designed. Each robot is independently actuated. In order for the three robots to coordinate for mobile robot, the kinematic model for orienting and commanding the velocities of these actuation is developed. Experiments are performed with PI controller for demonstrating the applications of developed mobile base with three spherical robots. With the experimental results on waypoint navigation and circular path following, the mobile base is shown to have unrestricted maneuverability in all the directions.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Ball Balancing Robot that can maneuver in indoor cluttered environments having onboard sensing like RGBD camera for navigation.
