Hey ! I'm Vaibhav Kadam, Roboticist from Mumbai India.</br>
- Currently working at **[Peppermint Robots](https://www.getpeppermint.co/index.php)** Pune India, with Robotics team focused on developing Autonomous Industrial Floor Cleaning Robots. </br>
- My work extensively focuses on development of Navigation Stack for autonomous cleaning and strategies for maximum coverage path planning.<br>
- Previously I was associated with **[IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)** as Research Assitant. I was fortunate to be advised by **[Prof. Leena Vachhani](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~leena/)** and co-advised by **[Prof Abhishek Gupta](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/?q=faculty/Prof.%20Abhishek%20Gupta)**. </br>
- I have contributed to Robotics Product development of **Spherical Robot** deployed with various security agencies for Homeland security. I had the opportunity to explore **Multi-agent systems** and **Modular Robots**.</br>
- In my undergrad research I have extensively contributed on implementation and development of control algorithms on Embedded platforms advised by **[Prof. Divya Shah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PkZCOlkAAAAJ&hl=nl)** and  **[Prof. Vishwesh Vywahare,](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=tl-6kkYAAAAJ&hl=en)**.
