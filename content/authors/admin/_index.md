I am a Senior Robotics Engineer at **[Peppermint Robots](https://www.getpeppermint.co/index.php)** developing Autonomous Industrial Floor Cleaning Robots. My work extensively focuses on development of Navigation Stack for autonomous cleaning and strategies for maximum coverage path planning.<br>
Previously I was associated with **[NCETIS](http://ncetis.iitb.ac.in/) [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)** as Research Assitant. I was fortunate to be advised by **[Prof. Leena Vachhani](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~leena/)** and co-advised by **[Prof Abhishek Gupta](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/?q=faculty/Prof.%20Abhishek%20Gupta)** at **[ARMS Lab IIT Bombay](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/robotics/people.html)**, I have contributed to Robotics Product development of **Spherical Robot** for various security agencies. I had the opportunity to explore **Multi-agent systems** and **Modular Robots**.
In my undergrad research I have worked on **Ball Balancing Robot** advised by **[Prof. Divya Shah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PkZCOlkAAAAJ&hl=nl)** and  **[Prof. Vishwesh Vywahare](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=tl-6kkYAAAAJ&hl=en)**. where I explored embedded control development.
