Hey ! I'm Vaibhav Kadam, Roboticist from Mumbai India.</br>


Currently working at **[Peppermint Robots](https://www.getpeppermint.co/index.php)** Pune India, with Robotics team focused on developing Autonomous Industrial Floor Cleaning Robots. </br>
My work extensively focuses on development of Navigation Stack for autonomous cleaning and strategies for maximum coverage path planning.<br>
Previously I was associated with **[IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)** **Autonomous Robots and Multi-robot Systems Lab [(ARMS)](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/robotics/people.html)** as Research Assistant, where I contributed to Product development of **[Spherical Robot](https://vaibhav02kadam.github.io/project/spherical_bot/)** deployed with various security agencies for Homeland security. I had the opportunity to explore **Multi-agent systems** and **Modular Robots**.</br>
I love building novel robots!!
